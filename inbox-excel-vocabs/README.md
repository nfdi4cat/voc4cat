**Please drop/add your updated Excel-file into this folder and create a pull request.**

See also [../README.md](../README.md) for the steps in the contribution process.

- If required change the file name back to its original name `voc4cat.xlsx`.
- Copy your file with the updates to this folder.
- Add the file to git and submit a pull request. On GitHub the file can be added by dropping it to this folder.
- If there are no validation errors the turtle files of the vocabulary in `vocabularies/voc4cat/` are updated via gh-actions and committed to your pull request. The Excel file is removed from the pull request.
- If there are errors, you can examine them in the run log.
- In any case (error or not) you can download the xlsx file along with a log-file and the generated documentation as [workflow artifact](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/downloading-workflow-artifacts).
The xlsx-file in the artifact will be an updated one that is either recreated from the updated turtle-files or (in case of errors) annotated.
