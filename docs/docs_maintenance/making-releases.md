# Making Releases on GitHub

```{note} This guide is only relevant for maintainers with commit rights.
```

## Overview

Releases in the voc4cat repository publish versioned snapshots of the vocabulary and documentation to permanent URLs following the pattern `https://w3id.org/nfdi4cat/voc4cat/vYYYY-MM-DD`. The release process is automated via GitHub Actions, triggered by pushing a tag with the version pattern.

The voc4cat version tags reflect the date when a release is created.
Tags must follow the pattern `vYYYY-MM-DD`:

- `v2025-05-22` ✓ Correct
- `2025-05-22` ✗ Wrong (missing 'v' prefix)
- `v20250522` ✗ Wrong (missing hyphens)

## Prerequisites

Before creating a release, ensure:

1. All vocabulary changes have been merged to the `main` branch
2. The development version (`/dev/`) has been rebuilt and is accessible at <https://w3id.org/nfdi4cat/voc4cat/dev>
3. You have tested the development documentation to verify correctness
4. You have commit/push rights to the repository

## Release Process

### Step 1: Update Release Information in Documentation

The `docs/index.md` file contains references to the latest release version that need to be updated before creating a new release.

Navigate to your local clone of the voc4cat repository. Make sure you are on the main branch and have the latest changes:

```bat
C:\Users\dlinke\MyProg_local\gh-nfdi4cat\voc4cat
λ git switch main
λ git pull
```

Create a feature branch for the documentation update:

```bat
C:\Users\dlinke\MyProg_local\gh-nfdi4cat\voc4cat(main -> origin)
λ git switch -c release-prep-vYYYY-MM-DD
Switched to a new branch 'release-prep-vYYYY-MM-DD'
```

Update 2 files in the `docs/` folder:

1. The announcement banner (in `docs/conf.py`):
   ```python
   "announcement": 'New: <strong> Release YYYY-MM-DD </strong> includes ...',
   ```

2. The latest release reference (in `docs/index.md`):
   ```markdown
   +++
   <small>Latest release **vYYYY-MM-DD**</small>
   ```

3. Add the new release to the "All releases" section (in `docs/index.md`):
   ```markdown
   - **vYYYY-MM-DD**: [Documentation (HTML)](https://w3id.org/nfdi4cat/voc4cat/vYYYY-MM-DD), permanent url `https://w3id.org/nfdi4cat/voc4cat/vYYYY-MM-DD`
   ```

### Step 2: Create and Merge Pull Request

Commit and push your documentation changes:

```bat
C:\Users\dlinke\MyProg_local\gh-nfdi4cat\voc4cat(release-prep-vYYYY-MM-DD)
λ git add docs/index.md docs/conf.py

C:\Users\dlinke\MyProg_local\gh-nfdi4cat\voc4cat(release-prep-vYYYY-MM-DD)
λ git commit -m "Prepare documentation for vYYYY-MM-DD release"

C:\Users\dlinke\MyProg_local\gh-nfdi4cat\voc4cat(release-prep-vYYYY-MM-DD)
λ git push --set-upstream origin release-prep-vYYYY-MM-DD
```

Create a pull request on GitHub and get the PR reviewed and approved by another maintainer.

Then merge it to `main`. After merging, delete the feature branch on GitHub.

### Step 3: Pull Updated Main Branch

Switch back to main and pull the merged changes:

```bat
C:\Users\dlinke\MyProg_local\gh-nfdi4cat\voc4cat(release-prep-vYYYY-MM-DD)
λ git switch main
Switched to branch 'main'

C:\Users\dlinke\MyProg_local\gh-nfdi4cat\voc4cat(main -> origin)
λ git pull
```

Clean up the local feature branch:

```bat
C:\Users\dlinke\MyProg_local\gh-nfdi4cat\voc4cat(main -> origin)
λ git branch -d release-prep-vYYYY-MM-DD
```

### Step 4: Create and Push Release Tag

Create an annotated tag following the pattern `vYYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `v2025-05-22`):

```bat
C:\Users\dlinke\MyProg_local\gh-nfdi4cat\voc4cat(main -> origin)
λ git tag -a v2025-05-22 -m "Release v2025-05-22"
```

Push the tag to GitHub:

```bat
C:\Users\dlinke\MyProg_local\gh-nfdi4cat\voc4cat(main -> origin)
λ git push origin v2025-05-22
Enumerating objects: 1, done.
Counting objects: 100% (1/1), done.
Writing objects: 100% (1/1), 164 bytes | 164.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 1 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
To https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat.git
 * [new tag]         v2025-05-22 -> v2025-05-22
```

### Step 5: Monitor Automated Publish Workflow

The push of a tag matching `v[0-9]+-[0-9]+-[0-9]+` triggers the `.github/workflows/publish.yml` workflow automatically. This workflow:

1. Checks out the tagged commit and the `gh-pages` branch
2. Builds the joined vocabulary file from individual Turtle files
3. Generates pyLODE documentation (HTML)
4. Creates Excel and XML/RDF files from the vocabulary
5. Builds the Sphinx documentation site
6. Copies all outputs to both `publish/latest/` and `publish/vYYYY-MM-DD/` directories
7. Publishes everything to the `gh-pages` branch

Monitor the workflow:

1. Navigate to <https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat/actions>
2. Look for the "Publish" workflow run triggered by your tag
3. Wait for completion (typically 5-10 minutes)
4. Check for any errors in the workflow logs

```{warning}
If the publish workflow fails, the release is incomplete. Check the workflow logs and fix any issues. You may need to delete the tag, fix the problem, and retry.
```

To delete a tag and retry:
```bash
git tag -d vYYYY-MM-DD  # delete local tag
git push --delete origin vYYYY-MM-DD  # delete remote tag
```

### Step 6: Create GitHub Release

Once the publish workflow completes successfully, create a GitHub Release from the tag:

1. Navigate to <https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat/releases>
2. Click "Draft a new release"
3. Click "Choose a tag" and select your version tag (e.g., `v2025-05-22`)
4. Set the release title to match the tag (e.g., `v2025-05-22`)
5. In the release notes, summarize the changes included in the new release. Follow the style of the previous release notes.
6. Check "Set as the latest release"
7. Click "Publish release"

### Step 7: Verify Release

After publishing, verify the release is accessible:

1. Check the permanent URL: `https://w3id.org/nfdi4cat/voc4cat/vYYYY-MM-DD`
2. Verify the latest release redirects: `https://w3id.org/nfdi4cat/voc4cat`
3. Check the Sphinx documentation site includes the new release
4. Download and verify the Excel file from `https://nfdi4cat.github.io/voc4cat/vYYYY-MM-DD/voc4cat.xlsx`

## Release Artifacts

Each release publishes the following artifacts to the `gh-pages` branch under both `latest/` and `vYYYY-MM-DD/` directories:

| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `index.html` | pyLODE-generated HTML documentation of the vocabulary |
| `voc4cat.ttl` | Joined Turtle/SKOS file containing the complete vocabulary |
| `voc4cat.xml` | RDF/XML format of the vocabulary |
| `voc4cat.xlsx` | Excel file generated from the vocabulary (for contributors) |
| `voc4cat/` | Directory with individual Turtle files (one per concept/collection) |
| `voc4cat.log` | Log file from voc4cat-tool operations |

The Sphinx documentation site is published to the root of `gh-pages`.

## Troubleshooting

### Yanking a Release

If a release is published with critical errors:

1. Mark it as "Pre-release" or delete it in the GitHub Releases UI
2. Add an entry to the "Yanked releases" section in `docs/index.md`
3. Create a new corrected release with an incremented date
