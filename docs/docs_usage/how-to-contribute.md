# How to contribute to Voc4Cat?

```{todo}
Move and merge documentation on contributing to the vocabulary from [readme](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat/blob/main/README.md#contributing-to-vocabularies)
and {ref}`guidelines-v2.0 <docs_usage/published-guidelines-v2:5. contribution step-by-step guide>` to this page.

We should maybe also add a section about how to contribute to this dcoumentation.
