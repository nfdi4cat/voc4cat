## Excel templates

With version v1.0.0 of voc4cat-tool xlsx-templates have become optional.

Use this folder to provide your own custom template, for example, with a help or an about sheet.
If you name the template `default_sheets.xlsx` it will be picked up automatically
(this name is pre-configured in gh-actions).
Note that templates may not contain any of the sheets that are dynamically created in v1.0.0.

Therefore, **earlier template versions cannot be used** without adaption,
see [documentation](https://nfdi4cat.github.io/voc4cat-tool/migration-to-v1.0.html#step-4-generate-v1-0-excel-template).
